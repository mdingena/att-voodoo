# Voodoo Vocabulary

## Controlling Voodoo modes

- `"Suppress Voodoo"` can be said at **any time** to deafen Voodoo. It will no longer respond to any commands, except the awaken command.
- `"Awaken Voodoo"` can be said when Voodoo is suppressed. This will put Voodoo in **ready mode** which means it will listen to everything you said. **⚠️ It's strongly advised to suppress Voodoo before talking to other players or people in your meat space. Your items are at risk!**
- `"Attune Voodoo"` can be said when Voodoo is awake. This will put Voodoo in **attune mode** which means it will listen for incantations.
- `"seal"` can be said when Voodoo is attuning and is used to cast spells that require less than 4 incantations. **Spells that require 4 incantations will auto-seal!**
- `"nullify"` can be said when Voodoo is attuning and is used to abort casting. **⚠️ You will lose all items already consumed in the casting process!** To pause casting because you need to speak to another person, say `"Suppress Voodoo"` instead! You can continue with your incantation after awakening and attuning Voodoo again.

## Verbal spell component

A verbal spell component is made up of words describing a property and a source. For example, `fluid of silica` or `essence of fungi`. Each source has its own material spell components associated with it. For example, `silica` targets a glass flask or sandstone, while `fungi` targets various mushrooms. Some source words target many different materials, some source words are specific to only one or two materials.

You must always connect a property word with a source word using `of`.

All possible property words are:

- `aether` (like "eater")
- `artifact`
- `bonds`
- `essence`
- `fluid`
- `fragment`
- `heart`
- `skin`
- `sliver`
- `tuft`

All possible source words are:

- `babu`
- `dais` (like "dice")
- `earth`

- `revenant`
- `salt`
- `silica`
- `spriggull`
- `tera`
